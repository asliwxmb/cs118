/**
 * Given only 4 turtle commands, write code in App Lab to complete the drawings in each of the challenges below. 
 * Your goal is to write code that solves the problem as efficiently as possible using only the commands provided.
 * What does “efficient” mean? 
 * In computer science it can actually mean several different things depending on what you’re talking about. 
 * Work on these challenges, try to solve them in a way that you think is best and we’ll ask about efficiency at the end.
 * 
 * Do This:
 * Draw a 1 x 1 square to the front and left of the turtle as efficiently as possible. 
 * The program should stop with turtle in its original position, facing its original direction.
 * Once you think you have a solution, click the Finish button - it will appear once you run the program.
