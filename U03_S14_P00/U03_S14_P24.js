 * 
 * Wrapping Up Variables - This is Not Math Class
 * Hopefully you now understand the gist of working with variables. 
 * The major thing to remember is that every time you see an = sign it means that you are instructing the computer to set a variable to a new value.
 * The example to the right is something that definitely wouldn't make sense in math class, 
 * but you should be able to reason about it as a piece of code. 
 * Because it's code, you can also insert statements to display the value of variables as they change. 
 * You don't have to guess!
 * Do This:
 * 
 * Make a prediction.
 * As usual you should first look at the code given to you and reason about what it does. 
 * You should try to predict what the value of num will be after all lines have executed.
 * Insert 3 console.log statements.
 * Insert console.log statements into the existing code to display each value of num immediately after it's changed. (The animation below shows how to get started.)
 * 
 * Was your prediction right?
 * After you figure out the answer, if your prediction was off, try to understand why. Where was your misunderstanding?

var num = 0;      // set num = 0 
console.log ("num="+num);
num = num + 1;    // Add 1+0 = 1
console.log ("num="+num);
num = num + 1;    // 1+1 =2
console.log ("num="+num);
num = num + 1;    // 2+1 =3
console.log ("num="+num);

/**
num=0
num=1
num=2
num=3
