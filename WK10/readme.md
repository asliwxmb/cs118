- Learn about variable scope: local and global. 
- prompt the user for input.
- introduce the if statement to ask questions.

## Unit 3: Lesson 15


Background
In this lesson you'll learn the next step with using variables in programs by adding them to apps. 
There are a few things you need to understand about where you create variables in your code and how you refer to them. 
In this lesson we show you how to do it and you have to debug a few problems related to common issues that newcomers have with variables.

You'll also use an if statement for the first time in this lesson in order to make a game change screens once the score reaches a certain value.

We examine the difference between the = operator and a new one ==

Vocab
Global Variables vs. Local Variables (Variable Scope)
The == (equal-equal) comparison operator
If statements

Create a clicker game of your choice.  You will need:

Four screens: introduction, game, screen for winner, screen for loser.
