Unit 3: Lesson 16 - User Input and Strings
Background
Strings are a data type found inside of most programming languages. Strings are simply an arbitrary length sequence of ASCII characters. Since they can be any length and can contain all ASCII text, they are perfect for creating applications that accept and use arbitrarily typed user input.

Importance of Double Quotes

You may have noticed that the strings we've seen are wrapped in double quotes. These double quotes are not part of the string. Instead this is how you indicate that a sequence of characters is a string and not the name of a variable.

As you start writing programs with strings it is common to generate errors from forgetting to place them in double quotes. We're going to generate some of those errors now so that we can recognize them more easily later.



Do This:

This program generates many errors because strings were not placed in quotes.
Run the program before you change it to see the errors that are generated.
Add double quotes around all the strings so that the program runs without errors.
