- Adding buttons to our programs to create interactions with the user.
- Handling events.
- Developing debugging strategies.
- UI elements, events and event handlers
- Our Mid-Term exam will take place Friday Oct. 28th from 10 to 10:50 am.

## New Resources for Event-Driven Programming  Page 47 of 52  


1. We will now start programming in an event driven environment.  
- This means, our programs will respond to user events.
- For example, when you use your phone, you may be clicking on a button on your screen and something happens as a response.  - The button on your screen is a user interface element.  
- Clicking this element is what we call an event.  
- Events may be triggered by the user.  
- What happens as a response to the  clicking, is what we called "handling the event".  
- In other words, a function is called to do something.
- Old Unit 3: Lesson 9 is to be read only:

## Adding Buttons to our Screen  Page 48 of 52  


1. You will now learn to add buttons to a screen (UI elements) and connect (clicks) events with event handlers (functions)!  
- This will make our programs more interesting and fun!!

- Please notice these are different exercises in a new location.

## New Elements and New Event Types  Page 49 of 52  Next item


1. Now that you have used the button element with different event types, let's learn about other elements 
- you are already familiar with from using phone apps and web applications!

## Please answer and comment on a classmate's opinion:

- Imagine we have 3 textfields and a button in our screen:
- 3 Textfiels and 1 button

### TEXTFIELDS:
- #1) Create a textfield so that the user can type in his/her user's name and store the value in the name.
- #2) Create a textfield so that the user can enter his/her email address.
- #3) Create a textfield that displays textfield #1 & #2 
- #4) Create a button with the label "Proceed" that allows the user to update his/her email or proceed.
- #5) email button labeled "Proceed"
- a) How do you imagine this GUI (graphical user interface) should work?  
- b) What are the steps the user should take and do?
- c) What should the reactions of the "form" or "app" be?
