1. Learning to program in an event-driven environment.
- Adding buttons to our programs to create interactions with the user.
- Handling events.
- Developing debugging strategies.
- UI elements, events and event handlers
- Our Mid-Term exam will take place Friday Oct. 28th from 10 to 10:50 am.

## New Resources for Event-Driven Programming  Page 47 of 52  


1. We will now start programming in an event driven environment.  
- This means, our programs will respond to user events.
- For example, when you use your phone, you may be clicking on a button on your screen and something happens as a response.  - The button on your screen is a user interface element.  
- Clicking this element is what we call an event.  
- Events may be triggered by the user.  
- What happens as a response to the  clicking, is what we called "handling the event".  
- In other words, a function is called to do something.

### Overview & Rules: 
- In this activity,
- your team’s goal is to:
- acquire all the cards of a given suit and assemble them, face up, in sorted order on the table in front of you.
- However, each member of your team will play a specific role (see below) and can only perform certain actions.  
- Each role has an “event” to watch for, and a set of actions you must perform when that event happens. 
- During the course of play,
- cards are turned face up
- turned face down, 
- reordered, 
- and exchanged with other groups in various ways. 
- Stop once all the cards of your team’s suit are face-up, in sorted order. (You may have duplicate numbers.)

### The Setup: 
- Your teacher will assign your team a suit (clubs, hearts, spades or diamonds) and give you a set of 8 random cards.  
- Place these cards face-down in a row on the table.  
- Decide which end will be the “low” end so the Turn-Upper knows where to start and the Swapper knows which way to switch cards to put them in order.  
- Make sure the Exchanger knows where the exchange area is.

### To Start: 
When your teacher says “Go!” the Turn-Upper starts her action and everyone else should begin watching for their events to occur. 




## Adding Buttons to our Screen  Page 48 of 52  


1. You will now learn to add buttons to a screen (UI elements) and connect (clicks) events with event handlers (functions)!  
- This will make our programs more interesting and fun!!
- Complete the exercises at https://studio.code.org/s/cspunit3/stage/10/puzzle/1  


### Unit 3: Lesson 10 - Buttons on the Screen
#### Background
- In the previous lesson you were introduced to event-driven programming with an unplugged activity. 
- In this lesson you'll begin to develop your own event-driven programs by adding elements (like buttons)
- to the screen and attaching event handlers to allow your program to respond to events (like a mouse click).

#### Vocabulary
- Event: a user action or other occurrence that can be detected by a program. 
- Events can be used to trigger execution of specified blocks of code
- Event Handler: indicates which commands should run when a specified event occurs

#### Lesson
- Create an event-driven program with a button.
- Program the button with an event handler.
- Write a function to drive the turtle with a button click.
- Please notice these are different exercises in a new location.

## New Elements and New Event Types  Page 49 of 52  Next item


1. Now that you have used the button element with different event types, let's learn about other elements 
- you are already familiar with from using phone apps and web applications!

## Please answer and comment on a classmate's opinion:

- Imagine we have 3 textfields and a button in our screen:
- 3 Textfields and 1 button 

### TEXTFIELDS:
- #1) Create a textfield so that the user can type in his/her user's name and store the value in the name.
- #2) Create a textfield so that the user can enter his/her email address.
- #3) Create a textfield that displays textfield #1 & #2 
- #4) Create a button with the label "Proceed" that allows the user to update his/her email or proceed.
- #5) email button labeled "Proceed"
- a) How do you imagine this GUI (graphical user interface) should work?  
- b) What are the steps the user should take and do?
- c) What should the reactions of the "form" or "app" be?


## Lab/Assignment 4  Page 51 of 52 


- Create an Etch-A-Sketch App that allows the user to draw!  

- The user should be able to draw up/down and turn right/left.

- Use colors, images, buttons and any event of your choice.  

- Have fun!
